# SiegeMod

## Setup

This mod can be build using the build.gradle task.
Due to either a bug or my own incompetence the IntelliJ environment has set the compiler output
to full path on my pc. To change this go to "File>Project Structure". There you can change it.

## License

This mod is available under the CC0 license. Feel free to learn from it and incorporate it in your own projects.
